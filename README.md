# Cestimii
Curvature Estimation using Integral Invariants.

Currently, only the code itself is contained in here. In the upcoming days, more details and a proper installation guide will follow. Additionally, I will add parts of the datasets I used in the thesis.

Cestimii is part of the Master's thesis "Integral Invariants for Multiscale Curvature Estimations on Cell Membranes" by Simon Biberger. It was supported by a fellowship within the IFI programme of the German Academic Exchange Service.

The following two images show the mean curvature estimations using the regular and multiple scales at once curvature estimation framework with relaxed occupancy grids.
